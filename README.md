## Featured Projects

### FreelancePro

FreelancePro is an application that gives freelancers the ability to manage their invoices and get a bird's eye view of their outstanding invoices and their business.

#### Project Purpose and Goal

As a freelancer, I often found that existing tools were either overloaded with unnecessary features or too basic to meet the unique demands of freelancing. With this in mind, I designed and developed FreelancePro‚Äîa streamlined platform focused on helping freelancers efficiently manage clients, track outstanding invoices, and get a clear view of their business at a glance.

In its initial release, FreelancePro offers core features designed for simplicity and effectiveness, with a roadmap to expand into a comprehensive toolkit, including integrated invoicing and built-in client messaging.

My goal is to continuously improve FreelancePro to empower freelancers with a dedicated, versatile service, ultimately enabling smoother client interactions and financial management tailored to their specific needs.

### Vegas Hockey

Vegas Hockey is a social networking application made for the pupose of increasing the awareness of Inline Hockey in the Summerlin, Las Vegas area.

#### Project Purpose and Goal

Created a user-friendly mobile-first app designed to connect hockey enthusiasts and make finding games more accessible. Unlike existing solutions with closed ecosystems requiring invite codes, this app prioritizes discoverability with SEO-friendly architecture. The aim was to build an open platform for players of all levels to find games without barriers, enhancing community involvement.

Key features include editing check-ins with personal notes and integrated chat functionality, allowing players to coordinate and share game details seamlessly. This app fills the gap in the sports app market, where connecting for niche sports like hockey often lacks accessible, well-designed platforms.
